        <div>
            <p><b>friend</b> was created by Kenan Poole as a response to
                <br> <i>The Garden of Forking Paths</i> by Jorge Luis Borges.
            </p>
        </br>

            <p> I want to use this website as an example how to make an interactive website without javascript. Not only is it possible to do so, 
                but the folder for this website is similar to the book described in <i>The Garden of Forking Paths.</i> The labyrinth novel from 
                the short story was full of contradictories and out of order. In the same sense the name of the html pages are numbered but it would
                not make sense to read each html page in sequential order. There is a document that lists all the paths between the html pages
                clarifying the mess of a folder.
            </p>
